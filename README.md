# ramda-toolbox
A supplementary, standalone library for Ramda.js, similar to ramda-adjunct

I recommend checking out the [docs](https://github.com/juliancoleman/ramda-toolbox/wiki/Ramda-Toolbox)
for a list of available functions. More are being added daily for the initial release, so please feel
free to open up some issues if you find any.

### Note

All files are exported with `module.exports`. I have a fairly finite understanding on how treeshaking
works, but I understand the concept. If you'd like to contribute to the AMD side of things. Please
also feel free to open up an issue.
